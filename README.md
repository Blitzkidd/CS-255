Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The main project throughout the corse was DriverPass, having them address issues of not up to stand driving education. According to their research, more than 65% of people fail their driving tests at the DMV. This project is to provide better driver training through online courses and live instructions.

What did you do particularly well?

Thanks to this course, I can handle analyzing systems and representing pretty abstract concepts visually. The diagrams helped me not only understand these concepts but had me make them so I can understand their creation process to better understand how to analyze them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Possibly my UML Class diagram. It looks very clunky now that I look back and I wouldn't mind going back and sprucing it up with easier readability and less stuff going around on it.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Considering the user needs helped me sift out what was really needed and what wasn't in designing the system. I created the diagrams with the user interactions in mind and played them off the sequence to see how each class would be utilized. With this careful thinking in mind, the system can become something that is user friendly and not create any problems due to it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Accessibility is something this course has taught me that designs need. Yes, it would be cool to have it be stylish and for it to stand out but the core need for them is of the accessibility. I worried much less about smaller details in turn for getting the system itself to be easier to use with people who aren't as technical smart as others, helping them get the education they need without much hassle.
